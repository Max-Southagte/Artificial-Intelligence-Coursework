Repo to add and amend code related to our Level 6 Computer Science AI Coursework

Part a

    The following 32 bit long string is made up by random 1s and 0s.
    E=[0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1]

    A process is required to maximize the number of 1s in the blue blocks and minimize
    the number of 1s in the green blocks. Provide a solution to this problem using
    appropriate computational logic approaches.

Part b

    4Core Logistics Ltd is an international transport company. The company’s lorry has a
    load capacity of 35 tonnes. The goods that 4Core Logistics Ltd has a contract to carry
    are of 10 different types (or codes). Every time the company ships each good, it gets
    paid a certain amount. In order to maximize profit the company needs to maximize the
    amount it gets paid for shipping without exceeding the lorry’s total load capacity. Table
    1 below illustrates the items, weight and profit for the company. Provide a solution to
    this problem using appropriate computational logic approaches.

    Item type   Weight (in tonnes)  Value (in thousands of £)
    1           3                   126
    2           8                   154
    3           2                   256
    4           9                   526
    5           7                   388
    6           1                   245
    7           8                   210
    8           13                  442
    9           10                  671
    10          9                   348

Part c

    create a suitable Neural Network that can approximate the following function:
    y=3x+0.7x^2

    Show how it works via plots and/or suitable text outputs.

Part d

    A dataset is available containing 53940 market prices and various characteristics of
    diamonds. These can be briefly outlined in table 2 below. The dataset can be
    downloaded from the Module’s Moodle page. Create a suitable Neural Network that
    can predict the price of a diamond given a series of the above characteristics. For the
    purpose of this exercise you can use all of the data or choose not to use up to three (3).
    Show that it works via plots and/ or suitable text outputs.

    Data     |  Explanation of value in dataset
    Price    |  price in US dollars ($326--$18,823)
    carat    |  weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)
    cut      |  quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
    colour   |  diamond colour, from D (best) to J (worst)
    clarity  |  a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))
    x        |  length in mm (0--10.74)
    y        |  width in mm (0--58.9)
    z        |  depth in mm (0--31.8)
    depth    |  total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)
    table    |  width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)
